# OpenContami
Open Cell Microbial Contaminants by High-throughput Sequencing
https://openlooper.hgc.jp/opencontami/

The quality assurance is becoming an increasingly important issue in various research settings. NGS (next-generation sequencing)-based contaminant detections offer promising diagnostics to assess the presence of contaminants. Because biological resources are frequently contaminated by multiple microorganisms, researchers need careful attention to intra- and interspecies sequence similarities. OpenContami (https://openlooper.hgc.jp/opencontami/) investigates the origin of sequenced reads from user-uploaded BAM files and provides highly probable microbial contaminants present in the BAM files that may be contaminated by the laboratory reagents, sequencer carryovers, cross-contamination, etc.
